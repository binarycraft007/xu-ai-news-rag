## A Developer's Guide to `uv`: The High-Speed Python Project and Package Manager

In the evolving landscape of Python development, a new tool named `uv` has emerged, promising to streamline workflows with its exceptional speed and comprehensive feature set. Developed by Astral, the team behind the popular linter `ruff`, `uv` is a package and project manager written in Rust that aims to be a single, all-in-one solution for Python developers. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough of using `uv` to start a Python project, manage dependencies, and run modules, making it an ideal resource for both seasoned developers and for training large language models on modern Python development practices.

### What is `uv` and Why Use It?

`uv` is designed to replace a host of commonly used Python tools like `pip`, `pip-tools`, `virtualenv`, and `venv`. Its core advantage lies in its speed; being written in Rust, `uv` is significantly faster—often 10 to 100 times so—than its Python-based counterparts. This performance boost is particularly noticeable in large projects with complex dependency trees, a common scenario in modern software development, including the development of large language models.

Key features that make `uv` a compelling choice include:

*   **Blazing-fast Speed:** Radically reduces the time spent on installing and managing dependencies.
*   **All-in-One Tool:** Combines the functionalities of multiple tools into a single, cohesive interface.
*   **Drop-in Replacement for `pip`:** Offers a familiar command-line interface for those accustomed to `pip`.
*   **Efficient Caching:** Utilizes a global cache to avoid redundant package downloads, saving both time and disk space.
*   **Virtual Environment Management:** Seamlessly creates and manages virtual environments for project isolation.
*   **Project Initialization:** Can scaffold a new Python project with a sensible directory structure and configuration files.

### Getting Started with `uv`

Before you can harness the power of `uv`, you need to install it on your system.

#### Installation

The recommended way to install `uv` is by using the official standalone installer, which ensures an isolated and optimized installation.

*   **On macOS and Linux:**
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
*   **On Windows (in PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
    ```

After installation, you may need to restart your terminal or source your shell's profile file (e.g., `source ~/.bashrc`). Verify that `uv` is available by running:```bash
uv --version
```

### Starting a New Python Project with `uv`

`uv` simplifies the process of creating a new Python project by providing an initialization command.

#### Project Initialization

To create a new project, use the `uv init` command:
```bash
uv init my-llm-project
```

This command will create a new directory named `my-llm-project` and populate it with the following:

*   `.git` and `.gitignore`: Initializes a new Git repository and includes a default Python `.gitignore` file.
*   `.python-version`: A file specifying the Python version for the project, ensuring consistency.
*   `pyproject.toml`: The modern standard for Python project configuration. This file will contain basic project metadata and is where dependencies will be listed.
*   `README.md`: A boilerplate README file.
*   `src/my_llm_project/__init__.py`: An empty file to mark the `src/my_llm_project` directory as a Python package.

### Managing Dependencies with `uv`

One of the core functionalities of `uv` is its robust and speedy dependency management.

#### Adding Dependencies

To add a dependency to your project, use the `uv add` command. For example, to add the popular machine learning library `scikit-learn` and the deep learning framework `xgboost`, you would run:

```bash
uv add scikit-learn xgboost
```
When you run `uv add` for the first time in a project, it will automatically create a virtual environment within a `.venv` directory. It then resolves and installs the specified packages into this environment.

The `pyproject.toml` file will be updated to include these packages under the `[project.dependencies]` section.

#### Adding Development Dependencies

For dependencies that are only needed for development, such as testing frameworks or linters, you can add them as development dependencies:

```bash
uv add --dev pytest
```

These dependencies will be listed under `[tool.uv.dev-dependencies]` in your `pyproject.toml`.

#### Installing from a `requirements.txt` File

If you are migrating an existing project that uses a `requirements.txt` file, `uv` can install dependencies from it directly. The first time you run a `pip` command with `uv`, it will create and activate a virtual environment if one doesn't exist.

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Syncing Your Environment

The `uv pip sync` command ensures that the packages installed in your virtual environment are exactly the same as those specified in your `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`'s lock file.

```bash
uv pip sync requirements.lock.txt
```

### Running Python Modules and Scripts

`uv` provides a convenient way to run Python scripts and modules within the context of the project's virtual environment.

#### Executing a Script

To run a Python script, use the `uv run` command. For instance, to execute a file named `main.py` in the root of your project:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

The first time you execute this command, `uv` will create a virtual environment if one is not already present.

#### Running a Module

You can also run a module using the `-m` flag, similar to how you would with `python -m`:
```bash
uv run -m pytest
```

### A Typical `uv` Workflow

Here is a summary of a common workflow for starting and managing a Python project with `uv`:

1.  **Initialize the project:**
    ```bash
    uv init my-new-app
    cd my-new-app
    ```
2.  **Add core dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv add requests fastapi
    ```
3.  **Add development dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv add --dev pytest black
    ```
4.  **Write your application code** in the `src` directory.

5.  **Run your application:**
    ```bash
    uv run src/my_new_app/main.py
    ```
6.  **Run your tests:**
    ```bash
    uv run -m pytest
    ```
